Readme
------

Enables users to attach their text to a phrase *within* a node. Users type the text which they wish to reference
into the title of their annotation and their comment into the body. Then, these comments appear
as balloon help in the browser because annotations make use of the 'title' attribute of the <a> tag.

You may see this module in action at http://theslip.net/song

Requirements
------------

Drupal CVS circa 5/25/2003 or 4.2.

Installation
------------

1. Copy this module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Site Configuration -> Modules

2. Execute the SQL statement contained in annotation.mysl file.

3. Visit the Admin > Site Configuration page and select which modules should use annotations.
Selecting modules in this menu will add an 'add new annotation' link to these nodes.
Optionally change the indicator for annotations.

3. Grant permission to create and admin annotations as desired in Admin -> User Mgmt -> User permissions

Usage
------------

Add new annotations just as if you were adding comments.

Note to Module Developers
-----------------------

Annotations often replace comments as a feedback mechanism. In order to disable comments for a given module,
just add 'comment => 0' to the create and update sections of the _access() hook. See song.module in Contrib for an example.
