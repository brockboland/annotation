Readme
------

Enables users to attach their text to a phrase *within* a node. Users type the text which they wish to reference
into the title of their annotation and their comment into the body. Then, these comments appear
as balloon help in the browser because annotations make use of the 'title' attribute of the <a> tag. 

Requirements
------------

Drupal 4.0 or higher

Installation
------------

1. Copy this module to the Drupal modules/ directory. Drupal should
automatically detect it. Then enable the module in Site Configuration -> Modules

2. Visit the Admin page and select which modules should use annotations.
Selecting modules in this menu will add an 'add new annotation' link to these nodes.
Optionally change the indicator for annotations.

3. Grant permission to post and admin annotations as desired in Admin -> User Mgmt -> User Permissions

Usage
------------

Add new annotations just as if you were adding comments.

Note to Module Developers
-----------------------

Annotations often replace comments as a feedback mechanism. In order to disable comments for a given module,
just add 'comment => 0' to the create and update sections of the _access() hook. See song.module in Contrib for an example.
